# RJ-lox-int
This project is on pause, will implement lox in python first then c++ later. Its
too much to learn new concepts and using a language im trying to learn better at
the same time.
## Project Description
C++ port of the Interpreter for the lox programming language created by Bob Nystrom in the book Crafting Interpreters. This meansthat this is implementing part 2 of his book.

## Goal
The goal of the project is to write the interpreter using modern C++ idioms and features such as smart pointers, RAII, std::optional, etc. Having said that primarly the goal is for me to practice writing C++, but I want the code to feel like it was meant to be written in C++ and not that it is super clear that it is a port from Java code.
